Montreal Forced Aligner AutoSync Module

V1.2.0
------
Added support for Phoneme Marker templates provided in AutoSync.

V1.1.2
-------
Fixed bug on macOS that could cause the MFA application to fail without generating any phonemes.

V1.1.1
-------
Allowed MFA to quietly ignore words it doesn't understand instead of failing. A list of Out-of-vocabulary words will be printed to the console.
Fixed bug that would allow MFA application to continue running long after it should have timed out, causing Unity to freeze.
Made MFA window show notification to provide additional feedback to the user.
Re-exported Default preset to remove outdated module data, and add "(English)" suffix in preparation for future language models.

V1.1.0
-------
Added new options: autoRetry and maxAttempts
	If autoRetry is true, and the module fails in a certain way, the module will immediately attempt to run again. This can solve some rare issues and is enabled by default.
	maxAttemps defines the maximum number of times the module will attempt to run in a row if it keeps failing. The default is 2 - setting this higher won't necessarily make it work,
	but it will make it take longer!

Fixed issue with audio conversion that would cause formats other than .wav to fail.
Fixed bug that meant audio files with certain filenames would fail.
Made the module automatically ignore hyphens in transcripts.

Improved how results are loaded back in to prevent potential differences on Mac and Windows.

V1.0.3
-------
Fixed macOS issue where incorrect file paths would be generated, causing the output not being found.

V1.0.2
-------
Fixed further bug related to using a relative path for MFA_align application.

V1.0.1
-------
Fixed bug that prevented the module from working on systems that use the "," character as a decimal seperator.
Fixed bug where only an absolute path would be accepted for the MFA application on some systems.

V1.0.0
-------
Initial Release
